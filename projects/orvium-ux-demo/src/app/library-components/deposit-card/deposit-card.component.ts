    title: 'Got Whey? The significance of cheese whey at the confluence of dairying, environmental impacts, energy and resource ' +
      'biorecovery',
    abstract: 'Milk discovery and processing enabled human settling and thriving in various settings. The discovery of cheese led to ' +
      'the production of whey as dairy by-product. Although it can find application in food, beverages, personal care products, ' +
      'pharmaceuticals and medical treatment, cheese whey is a massive dairying residue world-wide (154 Mm3Â·y-1) with high organic ' +
      'and nutrient loads. About 42% is used as low-value products as animal feed and fertilisers or even directly discharged in ' +
      'water ' +
      'streams, leading to ecosystem damage by eutrophication. Recycling and repurposing whey remains a challenge for remote ' +
      'locations ' +
      'and poor communities with limited access to expensive ' +
      'technology. Anaerobic digestion is proven and accessible for utilizing whey ' +
      'as substrate to produce biogas and/or carboxylates. Alternative processes combining anaerobic digestion and low-cost open ' +
      'photobioprocesses can foster the valorisation of cheese whey and capture of organics and nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients ' +
      'into a microalgal biomass that can be used as food and crop supply or processed into biofuels, pigments, antioxi-dants,' +
      ' among other value-added products. Awareness should be raised about the economic potential ' +
      'of cheese whey surplus by developing ' +
      'an action plan that (i) identifies stakeholders, (ii) sets goals and achieves solutions,' +
      ' (iii) decreases technology gaps among ' +
      'countries, (iv) enforces legislation and compliance, and (v) creates subsidies and foments ' +
      'partnerships with industries and other' +
      ' countries for the full valorisation of whey. We propose a closed-loop biorefinery implementation strategy to simultaneously ' +
      'mitigate environmental impacts and valorise whey resources.',
